Studies indicate a lack of familiarity with reporting systems and the importance of ADR monitoring, resulting in a concerning gap between awareness and practice. [5] [6]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaigns like National Pharmacovigilance Week and #MedSafetyWeek aim to address these challenges by fostering public engagement and encouraging proactive participation in reporting adverse events, ultimately enhancing the overall safety culture surrounding medication use. [7][8]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, increasing pharmacovigilance awareness is essential for improving patient safety and reducing the burden of ADRs. Efforts to educate healthcare professionals and the public, coupled with the implementation of effective communication strategies and global collaborations, are vital to fostering a culture of safety and vigilance in the use of medications. As the field continues to evolve, leveraging technological advancements and strengthening stakeholder partnerships will be critical for optimizing pharmacovigilance practices worldwide. [3 [9] [10]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical Background</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmacovigilance, the science and activities associated with the detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects or any drug-related problems, has evolved significantly over the past two centuries. The term itself is derived from the Greek and Latin words &#39;Pharmakon&#39; (medicinal substance) and &#39;Vigilia&#39; (to keep watch) and reflects its primary aim of safeguarding patient safety through effective drug monitoring [1][4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Early Development</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of pharmacovigilance can be traced back nearly 200 years, when physicians began documenting adverse drug reactions through letters and reports. This informal practice laid the groundwork for more systematic approaches to monitoring drug safety [11] [4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the medical community recognized the importance of understanding the effects of medications, formal structures began to emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Institutionalization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The establishment of regulatory bodies in the mid-20th century marked a turning point for pharmacovigilance. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national regulatory agencies initiated structured pharmacovigilance programs to standardize the monitoring of drug safety globally. The WHO&#39;s Global Pharmacovigilance Strategy emphasized the need for comprehensive safety monitoring and the collection of data on adverse drug reactions to enhance patient safety [3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recent Advances</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, pharmacovigilance has expanded to include a broader scope of medicines, including herbal remedies, vaccines, and biological substances. This expansion reflects the continuous evolution of the pharmaceutical landscape and the necessity for robust safety monitoring systems to keep pace with new therapies and technologies [1] [4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovations in data collection and analysis have also improved the effectiveness of pharmacovigilance activities, allowing for more timely responses to safety concerns and better communication between pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities [12] [3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Key Concepts</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) refer to unwanted, uncomfortable, or dangerous effects that medications may produce, impacting patient safety significantly. They are categorized into various levels of severity, including mild, moderate, severe, or lethal, with severe cases often highlighted through black box warnings in prescribing information. [13]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ADRs pose a considerable public health concern, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality across all age groups, and represent a significant financial burden on healthcare systems. [14]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mechanisms and Classification of ADRs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classification of ADRs is critical in understanding their impact. They can manifest soon after the first dose or only after chronic use, making it sometimes challenging to attribute symptoms directly to a drug. [13]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably, ADRs are especially severe among older patients, where they can lead to functional deterioration and changes in mental status. Fatal ADRs predominantly occur in individuals over 75 years old, highlighting the vulnerability of this demographic. [13]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent studies have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying ADRs through innovative network-based methods, constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs that connect drugs, diseases, genes, and proteins to identify common pathways and mechanisms. [2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This understanding is pivotal in enhancing drug safety profiles and advancing personalized medicine by revealing complex human responses to medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance in Clinical Healthcare</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ADRs rank as the second leading cause of drug withdrawals and the fourth leading cause of mortality in the United States, underlining the need for robust pharmacovigilance practices. [2] [15]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Awareness of ADRs is essential for healthcare professionals to ensure patient safety and to make informed decisions regarding drug prescribing and monitoring. By improving the understanding of ADR mechanisms, healthcare providers can identify new drug targets and predict new therapeutic indications, ultimately contributing to safer medication use.

Organizations such as the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) focus on improving communication practices within the pharmacovigilance community through training, research, and innovative campaign materials. These efforts aim to strengthen the knowledge base around pharmacovigilance and enhance public understanding of ADR management [19] [14]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Training and Educational Initiatives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Education and training interventions are pivotal in addressing knowledge gaps related to pharmacovigilance. Structured training models, such as the Structured Pharmacovigilance and Training Initiative (SPHAR-TI), have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing ADR reporting and knowledge among healthcare workers. Studies indicate that comprehensive, prolonged training sessions yield better results compared to shorter interventions. Therefore, practical, on-the-job training where participants can observe and manage ADRs is recommended to improve the overall impact of training programs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[14]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Campaigns to Boost Awareness</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Annual events such as National Pharmacovigilance Week and #MedSafetyWeek serve as platforms to elevate awareness about pharmacovigilance. These campaigns encourage public participation in reporting side effects and adverse drug events, thereby fostering a culture of safety around medications. For example, the 2023 National Pharmacovigilance Week emphasizes &quot;Boosting Public Confidence in Pharmacovigilance,&quot; aiming to strengthen community engagement and trust in the system. The #MedSafetyWeek campaign, which operates in multiple countries, encourages all stakeholders, including patients, doctors, and pharmacists, to participate in the reporting process and emphasizes the importance of widespread awareness regarding medication safety [7][8]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Building Trust through Transparency</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To effectively enhance awareness, it is vital to create an environment of transparency and collaboration. Engaging the general public through accessible information and dialogue is crucial for building trust in pharmacovigilance systems. Campaigns should aim to reach individuals who may be hesitant to engage, as these interactions can significantly amplify the message about the importance of reporting side effects. By prioritizing communication and education, the pharmacovigilance community can work towards ensuring safer medication practices globally [7] [8]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Challenges in Pharmacovigilance Awareness</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmacovigilance faces several challenges, particularly in raising awareness among healthcare professionals and the general public. A systematic review indicated that a significant proportion of healthcare professionals (24.8% to 73.33%) are unaware of the existence of National Pharmacovigilance Centers [5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a generally positive attitude towards pharmacovigilance and adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting, with 20% to 95.7% expressing supportive views, only a small fraction (12% to 60.8%) has actual experience in reporting ADRs [5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Barriers to Reporting</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The underreporting of ADRs is a pressing issue, primarily attributed to a lack of awareness and knowledge about reporting processes[5] [6]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Knowledge Gaps</strong>: Many healthcare professionals do not understand what constitutes an ADR, when to report it, or the procedures involved in the reporting process[6] [20]</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Workload and Time Management</strong>: High workloads and competing responsibilities can discourage timely reporting[20]</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Perception of Impact</strong>: There exists a belief among some professionals that a single report will not lead to significant change, further contributing to underreporting[20]</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Communication Issues</strong>: Poor communication between healthcare providers and patients, as well as lack of support from healthcare authorities, can hinder reporting practices[20][21]\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Regional Disparities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation varies significantly across different countries. For instance, studies have shown a markedly lower reporting rate in several Middle Eastern countries compared to Sweden, where over 60% of healthcare providers actively report ADRs due to a more developed understanding of the reporting system and strong institutional support[6]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This disparity underscores the need for tailored educational and training programs to enhance knowledge and practice in pharmacovigilance across different regions [5] [7] [6]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Need for Education and Training</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Given these challenges, there is a consensus that implementing educational interventions is crucial.

As of January 31, 2020, a total of 9692 NCIP cases in China have been confirmed. Internationally, cases have been reported in 24 countriesand5continents.6On January3, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in samples of bron&not; choalveolar lavagefluid from a patient in Wuhan and was con&not;firmed as the cause of the NCIP.7 Full-genome sequencingand phylogenicanalysisindicated that 2019-nCoVis adistinctclade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respira&not;tory syndrome (MERS).7 The 2019-nCoV has features typical of the coronavirus family and was classified in the betacoro&not; navirus 2b lineage. The 2019-nCoV has close similarity to bat coronaviruses, and it has been postulated that batsare the pri&not; mary source. While the origin of the 2019-nCoV is still being investigated, current evidencesuggestsspread to humans occurred via transmission from wild animalsillegallysold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.8 Huang et al9first reported 41cases of NCIPin which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Whole&not; sale Market. Patients&rsquo; clinical manifestations included fever,nonproductive cough,dyspnea, myalgia,fatigue, normalor decreased leukocyte counts,and radiographicevidence of pneumonia. Organ dysfunction (eg, shock, acute respiratory distresssyndrome [ARDS],acute cardiacinjury,and acute kidney injury) and death can occur in severe cases.9 Subsequently, Chen et al8 reported findings from 99 cases of NCIP from the same hospital and the results suggested that the 2019-nCoV infection clustered within groups of humans in close contact, was more likely to affect older men with comorbidities, and could result in ARDS. However, the difference in clinical char&not; acteristics between severe and nonsevere cases was not reported. Case reports confirmed human-to-human transmission of NCIP.10,11 At present, there are no effective therapies or vaccines for NCIP. The objective of this case series was to describe the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIPand to comparesevere cases who received intensive care unit (ICU) care with nonsevere cases who did not receive ICU care.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Read More : <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fH2Q9pfGFepgFB-VTHu3p_dbUGqQhII-/view?usp=sharing\">Click Here</a></span></span></p>', 'corona-virus-disease-2019-covid-19-for-healthcare-professionals-2024-12-04-674fe1142b837.png', '2024-12-04 10:56:52', '2024-12-04 14:04:21'),

Rates of already-common conditions such as depression and anxiety went up by more than 25% in the first year of the pandemic, adding to the nearly one billion people who were already living with a mental disorder. At the same time, we must recognize the frailty of health systems attempting to address the needs of people with newly-presenting as well as pre-existing mental health conditions. Mental health is a lot more than the absence of illness: it is an intrinsic part of our individual and collective health and well-being. As this report shows, to achieve the global objectives set out in the WHO Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013&ndash;2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, we need to transform our attitudes, actions and approaches to promote and protect mental health, and to provide and care for those in need. We can and should do this by transforming the environments that influence our mental health and by developing community-based mental health services capable of achieving universal health coverage for mental health. As part of these efforts, we must intensify our collaborative action to integrate mental health into primary health care.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In so doing, we will reduce suffering, preserve people&rsquo;s dignity and advance the development of our communities and societies.

With strict environmental controls, automated mixing processes, and meticulous granule quality checks, the granulation process ensures consistency and precision in pharmaceutical production.', '<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">At Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Limited (HPL), the granulation process is a cornerstone of our commitment to precision and quality in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The granulation corridor and room maintain strict environmental controls, with a negative pressure differential relative to the corridor to ensure containment and prevent contamination. HPL&rsquo;s granulation facility is equipped with four advanced granulation machines: three from India and one from Belgium, all manufactured by KIA. The granulation room features a KIA Educated Conversion Line, a highly efficient system consisting of three key components: the gear high shear mixer, the gear FBD (Fluid Bed Dryer), and the dry discharge mill.</span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Before entering the granulation room, authorized personnel must follow a strict gowning protocol. Disposable or reusable garments are stored in the designated dress cabinet, and operators must don these garments in a specific sequence to maintain cleanliness and safety. Only those listed on the authorized personnel list are permitted to operate the granulation machines, ensuring a highly controlled environment. The granulation machines are operated via a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) system, with individual ID and password access for each supervisor and operator. Calibration and qualification tags are prominently displayed on the machines to verify accuracy and compliance.</span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The granulation process begins with the dispensing of materials into the high shear mixer (PMA 600). Initially, dry mixing is performed to achieve uniformity. Subsequently, a binder solution, binder paste, or pure water is added to the dry mix granules within the high shear mixer. The mixing process occurs at both low and high speeds, with the granulation endpoint determined by monitoring kilowatt readings according to the specifications outlined in the Batch Manufacturing Record (BMR). Once the granulation is complete, the granules are transferred to the Fluid Bed Dryer (FBD) through a closed system to ensure containment and prevent contamination.</span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In the FBD, the granules undergo precise drying as per BMR guidelines. The endpoint of drying is determined by measuring the Loss on Drying (LOD) as specified in the relevant BMR for the batch. Upon achieving the desired dryness, the granules are transferred to the hopper of the dry discharge mill. To achieve the desired particle size, an appropriate screen is installed in the mill, and the granules are sieved accordingly. The correctly sized granules are then collected in designated containers for further processing.</span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">A floor balance is available in the granulation room to accurately weigh the dispensed materials and the granules during the process. After granulation is complete, reconciliation is performed to ensure that all materials are accounted for, and the final granules are labeled and stored in a Work-In-Progress (WIP) area with appropriate documentation.</span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Before exiting the granulation room, personnel must remove their outer uniforms and dispose of them in the waste bin provided within the room.

Once approved, the materials are delivered through the primary hatch to the unweighted material room for initial inspection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the cleanliness of the containers is verified, along with the material details, the materials are transferred to the dispensing room, one at a time, based on the specific needs of the production process. The dispensing area is specially designed with a change room, which serves as an entry and exit point for all personnel involved in dispensing activities. Strict entry and exit procedures must be followed by all personnel to maintain the integrity of the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe dispensing room is maintained under controlled conditions, with negative pressure relative to the surrounding corridor. This ensures that any potential contamination is prevented from entering the dispensing area. A magnehelic pressure gauge is used to monitor the pressure difference between the room and the corridor, and calibration tags are checked to ensure proper functionality. When the door is opened, the gauge reads 0, and when closed, it maintains a pressure differential of approximately 10 pascals, well within the specified limits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithin the dispensing booth, all activities are carefully monitored. The booth is equipped with an HMI (Human-Machine Interface), allowing for precise control and monitoring of the process. The booth also features three gauges that monitor the performance of the pre-filter, intermediate filter, and HEPA filter, with calibration tags on each to ensure proper filtration. Fresh air enters from the top and flows vertically, passing horizontally through the inside grill to prevent air or powder from escaping outside the booth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo ensure precise weighing of materials, a dispensing balance connected to a printer is used. After dispensing the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), a printout of the transaction is taken and attached to the batch document for traceability and quality control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore dispensing begins, several safety and operational checks are performed. Personnel are required to wear protective gloves, goggles, masks, and hand covers. The condition of the room is verified, and the balance function is checked. A line clearance is taken from both the production and IPQA (In-Process Quality Assurance) officers. Additionally, the laminar airflow system is run for 15 minutes to ensure the dispensing environment is clean and safe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe dispensing operator receives the materials from the unweighted material room, following verification by the production officer and IPQA officer. These materials are checked for compliance with the material requisition, including the material name, code number, potency, batch or lot number, in-house retail date, and expiration date. Once all the details are verified, the material is transferred into the dispensing booth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInside the booth, a clean scoop is selected, and its cleanliness is checked by the production officer. The tare weight of the container, lid, polybag, dispense label, and other related items is then recorded. The required quantity of material is dispensed according to the Batch Manufacturing Record (BMR), and the quantity is double-checked by both the operator and the officers present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter dispensing, the used scoop is placed in a polybag and stored in a designated container for used items. A printout detailing the dispensed material, date, time, balance model details, product name, batch number, and both net and gross weight is generated. This printout is included in the batch documentation as per standard operating procedures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce the dispensing operation for a specific API is completed, the broken material container is returned to the unweighted material room, and dispensing continues for the remaining materials in sequence. All dispensed materials are then moved to the WIP (Work in Progress) room, and the dispensing activities are recorded in the logbook to ensure complete traceability and compliance with all regulatory and quality standards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt HPL, we ensure that every step of the dispensing process is conducted with the utmost care, precision, and compliance to provide the highest quality products to our customers.</span></span></p>', 'dafault.png', '2024-12-04 16:43:24', '2025-01-19 23:25:24'),

In patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of vildagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. Vildagliptin inhibition of DPP-4 results in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity of beta cells to glucose resulting in improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Treatment with 50 to 100mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta cell function. The degree of improvement in beta-cell function is dependent on the initial degree of impairment; in non-diabetic (normal glycaemic) individuals, vildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or reduce glucose levels. By increasing endogenous GLP-1 levels, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity of alpha cells to glucose, resulting in more glucose-appropriate glucagon secretion.

Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDistribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMetabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole&rsquo;s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExcretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1&ndash;1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.</p>', NULL, 'pharmacology-2024-09-12-66e288e3c1878.png', '2024-09-12 00:23:31', '2024-09-12 00:23:31'),

Moreover, per-treatment intravenous hydration with 1-2 litres of fiuid over 8-12 hours followed by adequate hydration for the next 24 hours is recommended. Repeat courses of Cisplat should not be given unless the level of serum creatinine is below 1.5 mg/100 ml, or the BUN is below 25 mg/100 ml.

It inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the haem of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Letrozole exerts its antitumor effect by depriving estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells of their growth stimulus. In postmenopausal women, estrogens are derived mainly from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which coverts adrenal androgens primarily androstenedione and testosterone-to oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2). The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in the peripheral tissues and the malignant tissues can be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn healthy postmenopausal women, single doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5mg letrozole suppress serum oestrone and oestradiol by 75-78% and 78% from baseline respectively. Maximum suppression is achieved in 48-78 hours. In post-menopausal patients, with advanced breast cancer, daily doses of 0.1 to 5mg suppress plasma concentration of oestradiol, oestrone, and oestrone sulphate by 78-95% from baseline in all patients treated. Letrozole had no effect on plasma androgen concentrations (androstenedione and testosterone) among healthy postmenopausal women after single doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5mg indicating that the blockade of estrogen biosynthesis does not lead to accumulation of androgenic precursors. Impairment of adrenal steroidogenesis has not been observed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPharmacokinetics: Letrozole is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (absolute bioavailability 99.9%). Food slightly decreases the rate of absorption, but the extent of absorption remains unchanged. The minor effect of the absorption rate is not considered to be of clinical relevance and therefore letrozole may be taken after, with or before food. Plasma protein binding of letrozole is approximately 60%, mainly to albumin (55%). The concentration of letrozole in erythrocytes is about 80% of that in plasma. Metabolic clearance to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite is the major elimination pathway of letrozole but is relatively slow when compared to hepatic blood flow. The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 3A4 and 2A6 were found to be capable of converting letrozole to this metabolite in vitro but their individual contributions to letrozole metabolism in vivo have not been established. The apparent terminal elimination half-life in plasma is about 2 days. After daily administration of 2.5mg of letrozole, steady-state levels are reached within 2 to 6 weeks.</span></span></p>', NULL, 'dafault.png', '2024-10-29 22:32:09', '2024-10-29 22:32:09'),
